      This a pure UI/UX project to mimic a commercial restaurant website. Most of the content, images, and icons are come from Coursea website. 
      
      <p> To execute this website, NodeJS (and npm) need to install locally. After that a "light-server" need to install local. Currently, there are some issues in the latest commits. 
      I suggest to checkout some recent commit and start the web application.<p/> 
      
      <p> All in all, once you fork the latest code and installed the NodeJS locally, please execute the following three commands one by one in your local directory. The web aplication will start.<p/>
      
      <br/> <b>npm install lite-server --save-dev<b/>
      <br/> <b>git checkout ef464fdf674d1bdce34c777170b57997c04d454b<b/>
      <br/> <b>npm start<b/>
